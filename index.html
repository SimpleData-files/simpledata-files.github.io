            <h2>What is SimpleData?</h2>
            <p>
                SimpleData is an unstructured data format designed to be human-readable and intuitive.<br>
                It has incredibly simple syntax and is meant to be written by humans and altered and read by programs.<br><br>

                Functional SimpleData syntax has three sections: identifier, separator, and value.<br>
                The identifier is used to read and update lines' values.<br><br>

                The value can either be a string, a decimal number, a normal integer, a single character, or a boolean.<br>
                Every file has to be run through a parser before use to check for invalid syntax.

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
                Now, you might be thinking, "Unstructured data has been around ever since structured data has, and everything's been fine.<br>
                So why should I use SimpleData and run my file through a parser, manually write it, and use your shitty API?"<br><br>

                Unless you're a complete idiot, parsing SimpleData will not be like compiling C code.<br>
                And the best advantage is that I've standardised this whole thing into one file format and<br>
                written a parser and an API (albeit a small one) for you.<br>
                Essentially, I've relieved you of having to write your own interpreter/parser.<br><br>

                If you feel like it, you may read the documentation <a href="documentation/index.html">here</a>.<br>
