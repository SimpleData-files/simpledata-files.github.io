				<h2>Syntax</h2>
				<p>
					SimpleData syntax is quite simple.<br>
					A hashtag appends a comment.<br><br>

					Identifiers must be unique and are used as the variable name, seperated by a colon.<br>
					The value can be either of the following:<br>
					<ul id="list">
						<li>An integer</li>
						<li>A floating point number</li>
						<li>A boolean (true/false) value</li>
						<li>A single character</li>
						<li>Null (either uppercase or lowercase)</li>
					</ul>

					Below is an example of the two above statements.<br><br>

					<img src="imgs/example_syntax.png"/><br><br>

					Another thing worth mentioning is that identifiers cannot have spaces between them.<br>
					There are also some default reserved identifiers:<br>
					<ul id="list">
						<li>"boolean"</li>
						<li>"bool"</li>
						<li>"float"</li>
						<li>"int"</li>
						<li>"integer"</li>
						<li>"string"</li>
						<li>"char"</li>
						<li>"null" and "NULL"</li>
					</ul>
					The reasoning for the above statements will be revealed in the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines section</a>.

				<h2>API</h2>
				<p>
					Currently there are two versions of the API: one written in <a href="#api_py">Python3</a> and another written in <a href="#cpp_api">C++17</a>.<br>
					As time progresses, I hope that I will manage to support more languages, but currently this is what we have.<br><br>
					Aside from some minor changes, the two APIs are essentially the same and contain two main functions: update() and fetch().<br>
					They also are both object-oriented but the two functions have non-object-oriented twins.<br><br>

					Naturally, update() updates an identifier's variable, and fetch() grabs it.<br><br>

					The APIs also contain two error-interpreter functions: errstr() and errfind().<br>
					errstr() is used within a class to interpret the last error code returned. Both spit out a brief description of the error code.<br>
					errfind() is used for the static functions, and takes a number as input.<br><br>

					Along with the above-mentioned functions, version() is also present in both APIs, simply returning the API's current version.<br><br>

					<section id="api_cpp">
						<h3 style="font-family: 'Norwester';">C++</h3>
						<p>
							The C++ SimpleData API is written using C++17.<br>
							The parameters for the non-static functions are as follows in respective order:
							<ul id="list">
								<li>The identifier of the variable to modify or grab</li>
								<li>Either where to store the value or the new value to replace the current one with</li>
								<li>The variable's type (string, float, integer, etc..)</li>
							</ul><br>

							But the static functions have one extra argument placed right before the third.<br>
							Here are the parameters for both static functions in order:a
							<ul id="list">
								<li>The identifier of the variable to modify or grab</li>
								<li>Either where to store the value or the new value to replace the current one with</li>
								<li>The file to be accessed</li>
								<li>The variable's type</li>
							</ul>	

							Templates are used for both sets of functions, which decide the type for each function's second argument.<br><br>
							<img src="imgs/templates.png"/><br><br>

							To use arrays, the template argument on both update() and fetch() must be a vector of std::string:<br><br>
							<img src="imgs/cpp_arrays.png"/><br><br>

							The APIs class can be instantiated with either of the following syntax, but both open a file for the class to work with:<br><br>
							<img src="imgs/cpp_class_init.png"/><br>
							<img src="imgs/cpp_class_init_2.png"/><br><br>

							Keep in mind that open() can be used at anytime in a classes existence to switch between active files.<br>
							Another thing I should mention, is that update() and fetch() will do nothing if an invalid file is in use at the current time.<br><br>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section id="api_py">
						<h3 style="font-family: 'Norwester';">Python</h3>
						<p>
							The Python API is written in Python3 and shares most of the same concepts and functions from the original C++ API apart from a few minor things.<br><br>

							Notably it uses, mostly, the same parameter structure:<br>
							<ul id="list">
								<li>The identifier of the variable to use</li>
								<li>The new value to replace the current one with (only in update())</li>
								<li>The variable's type</li>
							</ul><br><br>

							Like the C++ API, for static functions the file to work with should be passed as the third parameter out of five total.<br>
							Here's the parameter structure for the static functions:<br>
							<ul id="list">
								<li>The identifier of the variable to use</li>
								<li>The new value to replace the current one with (only in simpledata_update())</li>
								<li>The file to be accessed</li>
								<li>The variable's type</li>
							</ul>

							Obviously, for arrays to be used in update(), an array has to be passed as the third parameter like so:<br><br>
							<img src="imgs/arrays_py.png"><br><br>

							errstr() and errfind() still exist and work the same way, however the static functions are located outside of the simpledata class so that Python<br>
							does not mix them up with the non-static functions.<br>
							Below is an example of the new static fetch() function in Python:<br><br>

							<img src="imgs/img_6.png"/><br><br>

							As you can see, all of the static functions are now appended with "simpledata_".

					It is recommended to read both APIs source code to get a full understanding of the functionality of each if possible.

			<section id="parser">
				<h2>Parser</h2>
				<p>
					All .simpdat files have to be run through the parser before being able to be used.<br>
					It will identify any errors in the file and alert the writer of them so that they can be fixed.<br><br>

					The parser takes one main input: the file to check. It is designed for the command line and is quite easy to understand.<br>
					For example:<br><br>
					<img src="imgs/terminal_example.png"><br><br>

					The "./simpledata" part of the image is the parser executable, and the "test-file.simpdat" part is the file to be parsed by the program.<br>
					To make sure that only SimpleData files are passed, the parser only accepts input with files that have a ".simpdat" extension.<br><br>

					The parser also has another optional parameter regarding restricted identifiers.<br>
					The optional parameter (placed after the file to be parsed), is a programming language which defines what restricted identifiers shall be checked for within the file.<br>
					Currently, only C++ and Python are supported since they are the only languages that have APIs for SimpleData.<br><br>

					A few different ways of typing the languages can be recognised by the parser, and can be inputted like so:<br><br>
					<img src="imgs/terminal_example_restrictions.png"><br><br>

					Obviously, "language" would be replaced with whatever language's reserved identifiers you want to search for.<br><br>

					For Windows, the "./" part at the start of the executable would be removed (macOS and Linux use './' at the start of executables to run them, Windows does not) like so:<br><br>

					<img src="imgs/terminal_example_win.png"><br><br>

				<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<p>
					This section is the explanation section. I will cover how I designed everything to work and be used and explain my reasons for things.<br><br>

					I designed the SimpleData variables to be an echo of programming language variables.<br>
					Then that would allow me to make a variable in my .simpdat file and another local variable in my program with the same name.<br>
					Then I would presumably fetch that variable from the .simpdat file and put it's value into my program's variable.<br><br>

					To me, that is quite sensible. Because then I know that if I have a variable that has a spot in a SimpleData file, I can just fetch the required data instead of worrying whether I have the right data or not since both go by the same name.<br><br>

					This is also the reason for the restricted identifier names. In C++ at least, "bool", "float", "char", "int", and "NULL" can't be used as variable names as they are used for other things.<br>

					The static functions exist simply for convenience. The logic is that if someone wants to access only one or two variables in a file, why should they have to instantiate a class only to delete it a few moments later?<br><br>

					Another thing you might find odd is the existence of the "type" parameter for fetch() in the C++ API.<br>
					It is only used so that constexpr does not screw up the conversions and spit out something stupid.<br><br>

					Another thing worth mentioning is that I designed SimpleData files to be written by humans and then altered/read by computer programs.<br>If I had designed it solely for computers, I wouldn't have bothered with adding comments.
